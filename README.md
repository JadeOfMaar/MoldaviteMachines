This mod provides new, freely licensed greenhouse parts as alternative to the tried and true, but aged, ZZZ greenhouse and other parts from that era.

Introduces two weightless resources: 
* **Algae** (specifically for light-based water splitting for Hydrogen (for fuel) and Oxygen (the waste product, but needed for breathing)). This is held and produced in the Algae Farms.
* **Photoculture** (representing microbe life which specializes in feeding on Carbon Dioxide and producing Carbon-based useful chemicals). This is held and produced in the Photobioreactors.

Designed for use with TAC life support and Interstellar Flight Inc (IFI) life support.

## Initial Compatibility
